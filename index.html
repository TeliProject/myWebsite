            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div class="about-content">
                <p>I'm a Mechanical Engineer with 15 years experience between defense and aerospace and the consuer electronics industry. <br>
                    I'm more of a general engineer in that I do a lot of prototyping across many different specializations. I started in R&D <br>
                    Designing in the defense industry prototyping radiometers for research scientitsts. I also gained experience in Lifecycle <br>
                    and Environmental engineering before completely shifting gears and switching industries. I moved to WA state and started <br>
                    work as a Design Verification Engineer at Microsoft. I then switched over to Meta as a Mechanical Design Engineer. <br><br>
                    I have experience in DFM/DFA with machined, injection molded, thixomolded, MIMS, and sheet metal parts for various applications, <br>
                    mostly for large scale data collections of body worn devices. These data collections have been used to train ML models to unlock <br>
                    things like hand and body tracking on devices like Quest 3 and the Meta RayBan series of glasses. <br><br>
                    When I'm not prototyping and designing fancy body worn stuff and performing other engineering tasks at work, I am usually at home <br>
                    prototyping and designing other fancy devices for fun around the house. That is the focus of this website. I am doing mostly as a <br> 
                    way to do something I have never really done well to this point. Documentation. I am not going to focus on past projects, but rather <br>
                    what I am dong right now. <br><br>
                    It's December 2025 as I am writing this and the things that are interesting me now are robotic actuators. Maybe I will get to actual <br>
                    robots in the future, but for now I am focusing on learning and understanding the things that make them go.
